## Workflow

When you type **`https://www.amazon.com`** into your browser and hit Enter, a complex series of steps takes place behind the scenes to serve you the Amazon website. Here's a detailed explanation of how a web request to Amazon.com works and is served:

## **1. DNS Resolution**
1. **Browser Cache**: The browser first checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address for `www.amazon.com`.
2. **OS Cache**: If not found, the browser asks the operating system for the IP address.
3. **Router Cache**: If the OS doesn't know, the request is sent to your router.
4. **ISP DNS Server**: If the router doesn't have the information, the request is forwarded to your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) DNS server.
5. **Recursive DNS Lookup**: If the ISP's DNS server doesn't have the IP address, it performs a recursive lookup:
   - It queries the **root DNS servers** to find the authoritative DNS server for `.com`.
   - It then queries the `.com` authoritative server to find the DNS server for `amazon.com`.
   - Finally, it queries Amazon's DNS server to get the IP address for `www.amazon.com`.
6. The IP address is returned to your browser.

## **2. Establishing a Connection (TCP Handshake)**
1. **TCP Handshake**: Your browser initiates a **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** connection with Amazon's server using the IP address obtained.
   - **SYN**: Your browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
   - **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
   - **ACK**: Your browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet to confirm the connection.
2. **TLS/SSL Handshake**: Since the request is over HTTPS, a **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** handshake occurs to establish a secure connection:
   - Your browser and Amazon's server agree on encryption protocols.
   - The server sends its SSL certificate, which your browser verifies.
   - A symmetric encryption key is exchanged for secure communication.

---

## **3. Sending the HTTP Request**
1. **HTTP Request**: Your browser sends an **HTTP GET request** to Amazon's server, asking for the content of `https://www.amazon.com`.
   - The request includes headers like `User-Agent`, `Accept-Language`, and `Cookies`.
2. **Load Balancer**: The request first reaches Amazon's **load balancer**, which distributes the request to one of many backend servers based on factors like server load and geographic location.

---

## **4. Processing the Request on Amazon's Server**
1. **Web Server**: The request is handled by a **web server** (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or Amazon's custom server).
2. **Application Server**: The web server forwards the request to an **application server**, which runs the business logic of Amazon's website.
3. **Database Queries**: The application server may query **databases** (e.g., product information, user data) to fetch relevant data.
4. **Caching**: Amazon uses **caching systems** (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to serve frequently accessed data quickly.
5. **Content Generation**: The application server generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the webpage.

---

## **5. Serving the Response**
1. **HTTP Response**: The server sends an **HTTP response** back to your browser, including:
   - **Status code** (e.g., 200 OK).
   - **Headers** (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`).
   - **Body** (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content).
2. **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files are often served from a **CDN** (e.g., Amazon CloudFront) to reduce latency and improve load times.

---

## **6. Rendering the Webpage**
1. **HTML Parsing**: Your browser parses the HTML to construct the **DOM (Document Object Model)**.
2. **CSS Parsing**: The browser parses the CSS to construct the **CSSOM (CSS Object Model)**.
3. **JavaScript Execution**: The browser executes any JavaScript code, which may modify the DOM or fetch additional data (e.g., product recommendations).
4. **Rendering**: The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to create the **render tree** and displays the webpage on your screen.

---

## **7. Additional Requests**
1. **AJAX Requests**: After the initial page load, your browser may send additional **AJAX requests** to fetch dynamic content (e.g., product reviews, recommendations).
2. **WebSocket Connections**: For real-time updates (e.g., chat, notifications), your browser may establish a **WebSocket connection** with Amazon's server.

---

## **8. Monitoring and Analytics**
1. **Logging**: Amazon logs the request for monitoring, debugging, and analytics.
2. **Analytics**: Data about your visit (e.g., pages viewed, time spent) is collected for improving the user experience and personalizing content.

---

## **Key Technologies Involved**
- **DNS**: Domain Name System for resolving domain names to IP addresses.
- **TCP/IP**: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol for reliable communication.
- **TLS/SSL**: Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer for encryption.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure) for web communication.
- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
- **CDN**: Content Delivery Network for serving static assets.
- **Databases**: Store and retrieve data (e.g., product information, user data).
- **Caching**: Improve performance by serving frequently accessed data quickly.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic content to the webpage.
